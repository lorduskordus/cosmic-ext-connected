## Features

- **Device Management** - Pair, unpair, and monitor connected devices (phones, tablets, laptops, desktops)
- **SMS Messaging** - View conversations, reply, and compose new messages with contact lookup
- **Smart SMS Threading** - Automatically merges conversations that iOS reaction-over-SMS splits into multiple threads on Android, with a toggle to disable if the heuristic misfires
- **File Sharing** - Send and receive files and URLs, with desktop notifications
- **Clipboard Sync** - Send clipboard content to your device
- **Notifications** - View and dismiss phone notifications; desktop alerts for SMS and calls (with privacy controls)
- **Battery Status** - Monitor battery level and charging state
- **Media Controls** - Control music playback (play/pause, next/previous, volume)
- **Find My Phone** - Ring or ping your phone to locate it

 ### SMS Reaction-Thread Merging

When someone reacts to an SMS from iOS, Android often files the reaction into a separate thread from the original conversation. Connected detects these split threads and merges them on the desktop side, with a one-click toggle to switch between merged and split views.
