# Changelog

All notable changes to Connected will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **SMS: merged-conversation indicators and SMS-view toggle.** Conversations that Connected has merged from multiple phone-side threads (the iOS-reaction-over-SMS case) now show a small marker on the conversation list. A new toggle in the SMS view header switches between the merged and split views in one click — useful if the heuristic misfires for a particular conversation, or just to see what the phone's underlying thread structure looks like. The toggle shares state with the new SMS settings option.
- **SMS: split-thread indicators when merging is off.** When the merge toggle is off, conversations whose underlying threads are reaction-bucket siblings on the phone now show a passive marker on the conversation list. At-a-glance visibility into which conversations would merge if the feature were enabled.

### Fixed
- **SMS: iOS reaction-over-SMS no longer splits a conversation across multiple threads.** Threads with identical participants on the same SIM are merged into one logical conversation, and replies route through the merged set. **As a side effect, replying on these conversations now delivers a single copy to recipients — previously, AOSP canonicalization across the split could produce duplicate delivery.** A toggle in SMS settings lets you disable merging if it misfires on your carrier/device combo.
- **Notification dismiss button no longer clips past the popup edge** when the message text contains long unbreakable content (e.g. tracking URLs in shipment SMS).
- **Conversation list previews render at uniform single-line height** — multi-line message bodies are normalized to a single line in the list. The full body still renders in the thread view.
- **SMS: switching between paired phones no longer mixes the prior device's threads into the new device's conversation list.** The raw conversation cache is now cleared on device switch and seeded from prefetched data on open, so toggling the merge setting right after opening a prefetched SMS view doesn't collapse the list either.
- **SMS notification dedup is now scoped per-device.** Thread IDs are device-local, so phone A's thread 1234 and phone B's thread 1234 are unrelated conversations; previously, a numeric thread-id collision across phones could swallow a real notification in a narrow timing window.

### Changed
- **Internal refactor:** SMS conversation state extracted from the main applet module into a dedicated `SmsConversationStore`. No user-visible change on its own; enables the reaction-thread merging feature above and unlocks targeted SMS tests in v0.6.0.
- **UI:** "New message", "Add recipient", and "Pair device" `+` icons now use the COSMIC accent color so the primary action stands out from neutral row content.
- **Internal:** Release builds emit only `warn`/`error` log levels by default — set `RUST_LOG=cosmic_ext_connected=info` (or `=debug`) for verbose output during diagnostics. Debug builds still default to debug-level. `APP_ID` constant deduplicated to a single definition site.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Desktop / laptop peer support; "Show non-mobile devices" setting; inline share primitives on non-mobile device page; Enter-to-send on share-text inputs.
- Hover tooltips on the refresh, settings, and notification-dismiss icon buttons

### Changed
- Accent color restricted to actionable UI; tightened device page layout; Pair/Unpair moved into the actions list; notification count rendered as a badge.

### Fixed
- Pair-state updates more reliable: subscribe to the correct upstream D-Bus signal names (`pairStateChanged` and daemon-level `pairingRequestsChanged`), replacing three names that did not exist in upstream KDE Connect. Pair-state was previously riding only on the `PropertiesChanged` catch-all
- Pair-state updates no longer silently dropped during signal bursts: a follow-up refresh now fires after each signal-triggered fetch, picking up settled state even when trailing signals fall inside the 3 s debounce window
- Pair acceptance picked up promptly when accepting on the phone right after sending the request from Connected: a 1 s tick now flushes any deferred refresh once the debounce window clears, so the UI no longer hangs on "Waiting for device to accept" until the next ambient signal
- SMS thread truncation on first open: re-issues requestConversation when the daemon re-emits conversationLoaded with more messages than we received, and as a fallback on phone-response timeout.
- Message thread auto-scrolls to the newest message on open even for cached threads where the daemon doesn't emit conversationLoaded.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Replaced rfd/gtk3 file dialog with libcosmic's native xdg-portal file chooser
- Renamed symbolic panel icons with app ID prefix so Flatpak exports them to the host

### Fixed
- SMS message handling: optimistic send with body-based reconciliation
- Conversation list and message thread subscriptions converted to long-lived (fixes premature termination during bursty phone signals)
- Conversation list bootstrap: settles on a quiet window, retries once on small cold-start results, and re-reads daemon cache to merge late-arriving data
- Cold start false "no conversations" display (spinner shown until data arrives)
- Missing applet icon in COSMIC Panel settings for Flatpak installs
- Conversation list: long message previews no longer push the date and chevron off the right edge

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-12

### Changed
- Updated for libcosmic API changes (removal of top-level `cosmic::iced_*` re-exports)
- Track `Cargo.lock` to pin dependency versions

### Added

- Conversation prefetch on device selection

### Changed

- Replaced optimistic SMS bubbles with simpler sending indicator

### Fixed
- APP_ID mismatch preventing applet from appearing on panel
- Empty conversation list on cold start (increased timeout with fallback)
